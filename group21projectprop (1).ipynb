    "## Introduction ## \n",
    "Vancouver is well known to be one of the most expensive cities to live in Canada. Therefore we want to predict how much the cost of rent will be in Vancouver in the future. We will look for the average cost of a one bedroom in Vancouver in 2030, 2040 and 2050. The data set we will use includes average annual prices from 1990 to 2022. Based on this data we will use linear regression to predict the average price in the years we are looking for based on the variables of year (X Axis)  and price (Y Axis)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "To arrive at the conclusion, we will lookk at the dataset that we have gathered from (cite source) to understand the ongoing trend prevalent in the market. Using that, we will attempt to figure out the best estimate of the average rent for the next 5 years, as mentioned above.  " "We want to use linear regression as  the goal is to predict numerical values (price)
   " We want to visualize the results using a scatter plot and a line chart"
    "We expect to find that rent will significantly increase"
    "This could lead to future questions regarding trends in the housing market and the other variables affecting prices."
